# Myroslav - Baby Feeding Tracker PWA

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for tracking baby feeding times. It works offline and can be installed on a mobile device's home screen.

## How to Run

1.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## How to Add Icons

To add icons for the PWA, create two files:

*   `app/static/icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
*   `app/static/icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

You can use any image editor or an online generator to create these icons.
