# Myroslav - Baby Feeding Tracker PWA

## About The Project

Myroslav is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help parents track their baby's feeding schedule. It's a simple and intuitive tool that works offline and can be installed on a mobile device's home screen for easy access.

## Features

*   **Track Feeding Times:** Easily record feeding sessions, including the type of feeding (left breast, right breast, both, or bottle).
*   **Timer:** A built-in timer to accurately measure the duration of each feeding session.
*   **Statistics:** View a history of all feeding sessions to monitor your baby's eating habits.
*   **Edit and Delete:** Correct mistakes by editing or deleting previous feeding records.
*   **Offline Functionality:** The app works offline, so you can record feedings even without an internet connection.
*   **PWA:** Install the app on your phone's home screen for a native-app-like experience.
